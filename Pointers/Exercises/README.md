# Pointer and Memory Exercises in C++

## Exercise 1: Introduction to Pointers
- Write a program that declares an integer variable and a pointer variable.
- Initialize the integer variable with a value of your choice.
- Assign the address of the integer variable to the pointer and print out both the value and address of the integer using the pointer.

## Exercise 2: Pointer Arithmetic
- Write a program that declares an array of integers.
- Use a pointer to traverse the array and print out each element.

## Exercise 3: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Write a program that dynamically allocates an array of integers of size n (user input).
- Populate the array with values input by the user.
- Print the array using a pointer.
- Free the allocated memory.

## Exercise 4: Pointer to Pointer
- Write a program that declares an integer variable, a pointer variable, and a pointer to the pointer variable.
- Assign the address of the integer variable to the pointer and the address of the pointer variable to the pointer to the pointer variable.
- Print the value of the integer using the pointer to the pointer.

## Exercise 5: Pointers and Functions
- Write a program that declares an integer variable and a pointer variable.
- Pass the pointer variable to a function that modifies the value of the integer variable.
- Print the modified value of the integer variable in the main function.

## Exercise 6: Pointers and Arrays
- Write a program that declares a string (character array) and a pointer to the string.
- Reverse the string using the pointer.
- Print the reversed string.

## Exercise 7: Pointers and Structures
- Write a program that defines a structure representing a student with fields for name, age, and grade.
- Declare a pointer variable to the structure and dynamically allocate memory for it.
- Prompt the user to input values for the fields and store them in the structure using the pointer.
- Print the details of the student using the pointer.

## Exercise 8: Linked List Implementation
- Write a program that implements a linked list using pointers.
- Define a structure representing a node with a data field and a next pointer.
- Create functions for inserting elements at the beginning and end of the list and for printing the list.

## Exercise 9: Pointers and File Handling
- Write a program that reads a text file line by line using a pointer to a character array.
- Print the contents of the file to the console.

## Exercise 10: Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation (Advanced)
- Write a program that creates a dynamically allocated 2D array of integers.
- Implement functions for initializing the array with random values, printing the array, and freeing the allocated memory.
