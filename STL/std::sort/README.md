# Custom std::sort() Exercise

In this exercise, students will be challenged to design and implement their own version of the `std::sort` algorithm in C++. The purpose of this exercise is to deepen their understanding of sorting algorithms and gain practical experience in designing efficient algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithm Requirements

Your custom sorting algorithm must meet the following requirements:

1. The sorting algorithm should be able to sort an array of any comparable data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or custom objects.
2. The algorithm should sort the elements in non-decreasing order (from smallest to largest) by default.
3. The algorithm should be designed to minimize the number of comparisons and swaps necessary for sorting.
4. The implementation should be correct, efficient, and maintain good programming practices (e.g., clear variable naming, readable code structure, and appropriate comments).

## Challenge
Design your custom sort to be able to sort in _any_ way the user wants, like `std::sort` does.
The user should be able to pass a custom comparator function to the sort function, which will be used to compare the elements of the array.
(Tip: You may want to use function templates or function pointers to achieve this)
