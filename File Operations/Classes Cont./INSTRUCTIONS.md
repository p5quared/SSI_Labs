# C++ Shopping System - File Input/Output Lesson

## Overview

In this lesson, we will extend the previous exercise where you created a basic shopping system using classes for a cart, customers, and items. In this exercise, you will learn how to implement file input/output (I/O) operations to save and retrieve the contents of the cart. This will allow you to persist your shopping cart data across multiple program executions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have completed the previous exercise on creating a basic shopping system with classes. Familiarity with classes, objects, and basic file operations in C++ will be beneficial.

If you haven't completed the previous exercise, please refer to the relevant documentation or resources to understand the concepts involved.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Understand the concept of file I/O operations in C++.
2. Implement file I/O operations to save and retrieve shopping cart data.
3. Extend the existing shopping system to include file-based storage.

## Instructions

1. Review the code from the previous exercise where you implemented the shopping system with classes for a cart, customers, and items. Ensure you understand the structure and functionality of the existing code.

2. Create two new member functions for the `Cart` class: `SaveToFile()` and `LoadFromFile()`. These functions will handle the file I/O operations.

3. In the `SaveToFile()` function, implement the following steps:
   - Open a file in write mode using `std::ofstream`.
   - Iterate over the items in the cart and write each item's details to the file.
   - Close the file once all items have been written.

4. In the `LoadFromFile()` function, implement the following steps:
   - Open the file in read mode using `std::ifstream`.
   - Read each line from the file and parse the data to create new items in the cart.
   - Close the file once all items have been read.

5. Modify the `main()` function to incorporate the new file I/O operations. Add options for saving the cart to a file and loading the cart from a file. Provide appropriate prompts and handle user input accordingly.

6. Test your implementation by creating a few sample carts, saving them to files, and then loading the carts back from the files. Verify that the loaded carts contain the same items as the original carts.

7. Update the documentation and comments in your code to reflect the changes made for file I/O operations.

8. Submit your final code for review.

## Additional Resources

- Refer to the C++ documentation and tutorials for file I/O operations to deepen your understanding.
- Consult online resources and forums for further examples and explanations on file I/O in C++.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully extended your shopping system to include file input/output operations. You can now save and retrieve the contents of your cart using files, allowing you to persist your shopping data across different program executions. File I/O operations are essential for many real-world applications, and this lesson has provided you with valuable skills that you can apply in various programming scenarios.
